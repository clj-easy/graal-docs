# clj-graal-docs

## Rationale

GraalVM offers the ability to compile Java classes to native binaries.
This is possible to some extent with Clojure programs as well.

This little repo's goal is to collect scripts and tips to graalify clojure code.

## TODO

* [incorporate @borkdude's gist](https://gist.github.com/borkdude/dd0857cf1958b25496fddbdbf359ca59) which
is the basis for the script herein

## Scripts

### build-clojure-with-1472-patch.sh

Clojure 1.10 introduced locking code that causes graalvm's `native-image` to
fail.

[Clojure issue CLJ-1472](https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-1472) includes
potential fixes for this issue.

This script builds and locally installs:

* `org.clojure/clojure` `1.10.1-patch1472`
* `org.clojure/spec.alpha` `0.2.176-patch1472`

The patched version of clojure should work with graal's `native-image`, reference
it via, for example from deps.edn, via:
```
{org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.10.1-patch1472"}}
```

Prerequisites (installed via brew on macOS)

* clojure
* git
* git-extras
* maven

Tested on macOS Catalina.
