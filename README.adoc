== Rationale
This little repo's goal is to collect scripts and tips on natively compiling Clojure programs with https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM].

GraalVM allows us to compile Java classes to native binaries.
Because Clojure is hosted on the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine[JVM], compiling Clojure programs to native binaries is also possible.

Native binaries have fast startup times.
This makes them an attractive option for command line tools that are used for scripting and in editor integrations.
Popular command line tool examples are https://github.com/borkdude/babashka[babashka] and https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo[clj-kondo].
See link:doc/external-resources.adoc[resources] for many more examples.

Most of our tips are related to Clojure.
We will sometimes add a general tip because we didn't easily find it elsewhere and feel it would be helpful to others.

GraalVM is more than just its https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/docs/reference-manual/native-image/README.md[native image compiler], but unless otherwise noted, when we refer to GraalVM, we are talking about the native image compiler.

If you are trying to decide if GraalVM is for you, the trade-offs are nicely explained by Oleg Šelajev in the https://youtu.be/PeMvksAZbdw?t=647["AOT vs JIT" section of his "Maximizing Java Application Performance with GraalVM video"].

== Tips and tricks

=== Clojure Version
Always use https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/changes.md[the current Clojure release], it includes several GraalVM specific fixes, including:

* https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-1472[CLJ-1472] - locking macro creates monitor bytecode difficult to analyze in Graal native-image and ART runtime.
* https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-2502[CLJ-2502] - Cannot use clojure.stracktrace/print-stack-trace with GraalVM.
* https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-2571[CLJ-2571] - ex-cause is missing Throwable return tag.
* https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-2572[CLJ-2572] - Prevent reflection in clojure.data namespace, make compatible with GraalVM.
* https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-2636[CLJ-2636] - Get rid of reflection on java.util.Properties when defining \*clojure-version*

Other issues of interest:

* https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-2582[CLJ-2582] - Improve GraalVM native image size / compile time memory consumption when compiling clojure.pprint
* https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/TCHECK-157[TCHECK-157] - Randomization doesn't work with GraalVM native-image

=== GraalVM Version
Use the latest https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-builds/releases[stable GraalVM release].
Choose the JDK version that makes sense for you.

==== GraalVM Version Scheme Change[[graalvm-version-scheme-change]]
The Graal team changed their versioning scheme.
It used to be based on the year and quarter, but it now simply matches the JDK version.

We used to have, for example a v22.3.2 release for each supported JDK.
We now have, for example GraalVM v17.0.8 and GraalVM v20.0.2.

This version change does make it awkward to refer to past versions of GraalVM.
For the old version scheme we'll prefix the version with `legacy` like so `GraalVM legacy v22`.

==== GraalVM Free Flavours[[graalvm-free-flavours]]
We now have 2 free flavours of GraalVM:

* https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-builds/releases[GraalVM Community Edition]
* https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/[Oracle GraalVM]

Oracle GraalVM is has more features but https://www.graalvm.org/faq/#[has a different license].
Choose the flavour that makes sense for your project.

Tips should be generic to both flavours, but we'll refer to Oracle GraalVM if/when appropriate.

=== Class Initialization [[class-initialization]]
In most cases, Clojure compiled classes must be https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/optimizations-and-performance/ClassInitialization/[initialized at build time] by GraalVM `native-image`.
If this has not been done, when you attempt to run your resulting native binary, you will see an exception that includes:

[source,shell]
----
java.io.FileNotFoundException: Could not locate clojure/core__init.class, clojure/core.clj or clojure/core.cljc on classpath
----

Fortunately, we have an easy solution for you:

. include https://clojars.org/com.github.clj-easy/graal-build-time[clj-easy/graal-build-time] on your `native-image` classpath
. specify `--features=clj_easy.graal_build_time.InitClojureClasses` on your `native-image` command line

_Note: https://github.com/clj-easy/graal-build-time?tab=readme-ov-file#single-segment-namespaces[graal-build-time]  doesn't work with single segment namespaces. A single segment namespace is one without any `.` characters in it, for example: `(ns digest)`._

See https://github.com/clj-easy/graal-build-time[graal-build-time docs] for details.

=== Runtime Evaluation
A natively compiled application cannot use Clojure's https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/eval[`eval`] to evaluate Clojure code at runtime.
If you want to dynamically evaluate Clojure code from your natively compiled app, consider using https://github.com/borkdude/sci[SCI, the Small Clojure Interpreter].
The ultimate example of evaluating Clojure with a natively compiled Clojure application is https://github.com/borkdude/babashka[babashka].

=== Reflection
Clojure can use reflection to determine what to call.
But a GraalVM native image will only include what it thinks your program calls.
We can either tweak Clojure to not use reflection, inform `native-image` compilation about reflective calls, or both.

Take this little contrived example:

* `deps.edn`
+
[source,clojure,subs="attributes+"]
----
{:deps {org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "{clojure-version}"}
        com.github.clj-easy/graal-build-time {:mvn/version "{graal-build-time-version}"}}}
----
* `src/refl/main.clj`
+
[source,clojure]
----
(ns refl.main
  (:gen-class))

(defn refl-str [s]
  (.toUpperCase s)) ;; reflection on String happens here

(defn -main [& _args]
  (println (refl-str "all good!")))
----

It will compile just fine:
[source,shell]
----
$ mkdir -p classes
$ clojure -M -e "(compile 'refl.main)"
$ native-image -cp "$(clojure -Spath):classes" -H:Name=refl -H:+ReportExceptionStackTraces \
    --features=clj_easy.graal_build_time.InitClojureClasses --no-fallback refl.main
----
But when we go to run the native image, we'll see the following failure:
[source,shell]
----
$ ./refl
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No matching field found: toUpperCase for class java.lang.String
	at clojure.lang.Reflector.getInstanceField(Reflector.java:397)
	at clojure.lang.Reflector.invokeNoArgInstanceMember(Reflector.java:440)
	at refl.main$refl_str.invokeStatic(main.clj:5)
	at refl.main$refl_str.invoke(main.clj:4)
	at refl.main$_main.invokeStatic(main.clj:8)
	at refl.main$_main.doInvoke(main.clj:7)
	at clojure.lang.RestFn.invoke(RestFn.java:397)
	at clojure.lang.AFn.applyToHelper(AFn.java:152)
	at clojure.lang.RestFn.applyTo(RestFn.java:132)
	at refl.main.main(Unknown Source)
----

==== Use Type Hints to Avoid Reflection
Make sure you put `(set! \*warn-on-reflection* true)` at the top of every namespace in your project.
This tells the Clojure compiler to report cases where Clojure is using reflection.

[source,clojure]
----
(ns refl.main
  (:gen-class))

(set! *warn-on-reflection* true)

(defn refl-str [s]
  (.toUpperCase s))

(defn -main [& _args]
  (println (refl-str "all good!")))
----

If we recompile our Clojure source, we'll see a warning:
[source,shell]
----
$ clojure -M -e "(compile 'refl.main)"
Reflection warning, refl/main.clj:7:3 - reference to field toUpperCase can't be resolved.
refl.main
----

Let's add a `^String` type hint to avoid usage of Clojure reflection:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns refl.main
  (:gen-class))

(set! *warn-on-reflection* true)

(defn refl-str [^String s]
  (.toUpperCase s))

(defn -main [& _args]
  (println (refl-str "all good!")))
----

If we recompile our updated source:
[source,shell]
----
$ mkdir -p classes
$ clojure -M -e "(compile 'refl.main)"
$ native-image -cp "$(clojure -Spath):classes" -H:Name=refl -H:+ReportExceptionStackTraces \
    --features=clj_easy.graal_build_time.InitClojureClasses --no-fallback refl.main
----
We no longer see our reflection warning and our native image now works just fine:
[source,clojure]
----
$ ./refl
ALL GOOD!
----

NOTE: As an example, prior versions of Clojure's own `clojure.stacktrace` made use of reflection (see https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-2502[JIRA CLJ-2502]).
But this has been addressed via type hints.

Enable or disable the `*warn-on-reflection*` depending on the alias, the following methods are available for each tool.

- `leiningen`: Use `:global-vars` in project.clj
[source,clojure]
----
(defproject warn-on-refrection-test "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "FIXME: write description"
  :profiles
  {:dev {:global-vars {*warn-on-reflection* true}}})
----

- `tools.deps`: Use `alter-var-root` in user.clj

`dev/user.clj`
[source,clojure]
----
(ns user)

(alter-var-root #'*warn-on-reflection* (constantly true))
----

`deps.edn`
[source,clojure]
----
{:aliases
 {:dev {:extra-paths ["dev"]}}}
----

==== Specify a Reflection Config [[hand-coded-reflection-config]]
When you cannot add type hints, you can specify a GraalVM config for classes that are reflected at runtime.

If we go back to our original `src/refl/main.clj` that is absent of any type hints:
[source,clojure]
----
(ns refl.main
  (:gen-class))

(defn refl-str [s]
  (.toUpperCase s)) ;; reflection on String happens here

(defn -main [& _args]
  (println (refl-str "all good!")))
----

And we create GraalVM `reflect-config.json` with:
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "name":"java.lang.String",
    "allPublicMethods":true
  }
]
----
Then recompile specifying our reflection config:
[source,clojure]
----
$ mkdir -p classes
$ clojure -M -e "(compile 'refl.main)"
$ native-image -cp "$(clojure -Spath):classes" -H:Name=refl -H:+ReportExceptionStackTraces \
    -H:ReflectionConfigurationFiles=reflect-config.json \
    --features=clj_easy.graal_build_time.InitClojureClasses --no-fallback refl.main
----

We have success:
[source,shell]
----
$ ./refl
ALL GOOD!
----

See the https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/Reflection/[GraalVM docs on reflection for details] on the reflection config format.

==== Reflection Config for Arrays
To configure reflection config for an array of Java objects, you need to specify `[Lfully.qualified.class`.
For example a `Statement[]` would be specified as `"[Ljava.sql.Statement"`.

You can discover this name by calling `(.getClass instance)` in a REPL.
A contrived example:
[source,clojure]
----
❯ clj
Clojure 1.11.1
user=> (def foo (java.util.Locale/getAvailableLocales))
user=> (.getClass foo)
[Ljava.util.Locale;
----

==== Automatically Discovering Reflection Config [[reflection-discovery]]
To automatically discover reflection, you can use the
https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/metadata/AutomaticMetadataCollection[tracing agent].

To prevent false positives in the generated config, you can use a
https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/metadata/AutomaticMetadataCollection/#caller-based-filters[caller based filter].
An example `filter.json`:
[source,json]
----
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "excludeClasses": "clojure.**"
    },
    {
      "includeClasses": "clojure.lang.Reflector"
    }
  ]
}
----

To invoke the agent, you run your program wth the GraalVM JVM and add the `-agentlib:native-image-agent` argument.

Let's recompile our original reflection example app and then run it from GraalVM JVM with the tracing agent:
[source,shell]
----
$ mkdir -p classes
$ clojure -M -e "(compile 'refl.main)"
refl.main
$ java -agentlib:native-image-agent=caller-filter-file=filter.json,config-output-dir=. \
    -cp $(clojure -Spath):classes refl.main
ALL GOOD!
----

This will output `reflect-config.json`:
[source,json]
----
[
{
  "name":"java.lang.String",
  "queryAllPublicMethods":true,
  "methods":[{"name":"toUpperCase","parameterTypes":[] }]
},
{
  "name":"java.lang.reflect.Method",
  "methods":[{"name":"canAccess","parameterTypes":["java.lang.Object"] }]
},
{
  "name":"java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicBoolean",
  "fields":[{"name":"value"}]
},
{
  "name":"java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference",
  "fields":[{"name":"value"}]
}
]
----

The entry for `java.lang.reflect.Method` is expected, see link:#clojure.lang.reflector[clojure.lang.Reflector].

// TODO: Why AtomicBoolean and AtomicReference?

You then feed this generated reflection config to native-image just like you would for a link:#hand-coded-reflection-config[hand-coded one].

==== clojure.lang.Reflector[[clojure.lang.reflector]]

If you are suffering `NoSuchMethodError: java.lang.reflect.AccessibleObject.canAccess` exceptions, GraalVM needs a little help.
Include the following to your `reflect-config.json` file:

[source,json]
----
{"name": "java.lang.reflect.AccessibleObject",
 "methods" : [{"name":"canAccess"}]}
----

See also: <<reflection-discovery>>

=== Digging & Diagnosing

Sometimes you'll want more details on what GraalVM has done or produced.

==== Report what is being analyzed

Use GraalVM's `native-image` https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/debugging-and-diagnostics/StaticAnalysisReports/#call-tree[`-H:+PrintAnalysisCallTree`] to to learn what packages, classes and methods are being analyzed.
These details are written under `./reports`.

Note that this option will greatly slow down compilation so it's better to turn it off in production builds.

==== Visualize what is in your native image

To visualize what is in your native image, you can use `-H:+DashboardAll` and upload the `.bgv` file to the https://www.graalvm.org/docs/tools/dashboard/?ojr=help%3Btopic%3Dgetting-started.md[GraalVM Dashboard], here's an example screenshot:

image:doc/GraalVM-Dashboard-Screenshot.png[GraalVM Dashboard Screenshot]

NOTE: Apparently GraalVM is going to  https://graalvm.slack.com/archives/CN9KSFB40/p1687522043942749?thread_ts=1687169221.120249&cid=CN9KSFB40[stop work on the dashboard] and focus instead on HTML reports generated by `-H:+BuildReport`.
At the time of this writing `-H:+BuildReport` is only available in Oracle GraalVM and not in the Community Edition
(see <<graalvm-free-flavours>>).

=== Resource Usage
==== native-image RAM usage

GraalVM's `native-image` can sometimes consume more RAM than is available on free tiers of services such as CircleCI.
To limit how much RAM `native-image` uses set max heap usage via the `"-J-Xmx"` option (for example `"-J-Xmx3g"` limits the heap to 3 gigabytes).

If you are suffering out of memory errors, experiment on your development computer with higher `-J-Xmx` values.

Refer to `native-image` output for `Peak RSS` for RAM usage.

Actual memory usage is an ideal.
Once you have a successful build, you can experiment with lowering `-J-Xmx` below the ideal.
The cost will be longer build times, and when `-J-Xmx` is too low, out of memory errors.

==== native-image compilation time

You can shorten the time it takes to compile a native image, and _sometimes dramatically_ reduce the amount of RAM required, by using https://clojure.org/reference/compilation#directlinking[direct linking] when compiling your Clojure code to JVM bytecode.

This is done by setting the Java system property `clojure.compiler.direct-linking` to `true`.

The most convenient place for you to set that system property will vary depending on what tool you're using to compile your Clojure code:

* If you're using Leiningen, add `:jvm-opts ["-Dclojure.compiler.direct-linking=true"]` to the profile you're using for compilation (the same one that includes `:aot :all`)
* If you're using tools.deps via the Clojure CLI tools, add `:jvm-opts ["-Dclojure.compiler.direct-linking=true"]` to the alias you're using for compilation
** You can alternatively specify this property at the command line when invoking `clojure`: `clojure -J-Dclojure.compiler.direct-linking=true -M -e "(compile 'my.ns)"`

=== Optional Transitive Dependencies

A Clojure app that optionally requires transitive dependencies can be made to work under GraalVM with https://github.com/borkdude/dynaload[dynaload].
You'll want to follow https://github.com/borkdude/dynaload#graalvm[its advice for GraalVM].

=== Static Linking
==== Static linking vs DNS lookup

If you happen to need a DNS lookup in your program, you need to avoid statically linked images (at least on Linux).
If you are building a minimal docker image, it is sufficient to add the linked libraries (like `libnss*`) to the resulting image.
But be sure that those libraries have the same version as the ones used in the linking phase.

One way to achieve that is to compile _within_ the docker image then scraping the intermediate files using the `FROM scratch` directive and `COPY` the executable and shared libraries linked to it into the target image.

See https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/571

==== Static linking with musl

Using https://www.musl-libc.org/[musl] for static builds is recommended by the official https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/guides/build-static-executables/[GraalVM] docs.
Usage of `--static` without specifying `--libc=musl` will use glibc instead.
However, while this may look like a fully statically binary, this will still load some libraries (using `dlopen`) at runtime.
This may result in some segmentation fault errors related to glibc version mismatches.
See https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/FAQ#Even_statically_linked_programs_need_some_shared_libraries_which_is_not_acceptable_for_me.__What_can_I_do.3F[this section in official glibc documentation]
for more information on why glibc "static" builds are not really static.

With `--static --libc=musl`, you will have truly static binaries equivalent to Go's with `CGO_ENABLED=0` or Rust compiled with musl.
This can be deployed almost anywhere and is also smaller than the glibc equivalent.
However, keep in mind that `musl` builds https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/guides/build-static-executables/#prerequisites-and-preparation[still have some limitations]:

* Only works with Linux AMD64
* You will need to either use a distro that already have `musl` and `zlib` statically compiled in the repositories or compile it yourself.
** See https://github.com/babashka/babashka/pull/828 for an example of using `musl-tools` from Debian
** See https://gist.github.com/sify21/2eec007e4b05d448c85192fc279232c6 for an example of compiling `musl` from source
* There is a known issue with stack sizes in `musl` being really small by default and main thread not respecting stack size settings.
This may cause some stack overflow errors during runtime
** See https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/3398 for details about this issue
** See https://github.com/babashka/babashka/issues/831 for a workaround

If supporting non-glibc distros are not an issue for you, there is also an option of building a
https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/guides/build-static-executables/#build-a-mostly-static-native-executable[mostly static native image] that should work in any glibc distro.
Those binaries are very similar to Go binaries without `CGO_ENABLED=0` and Rust images build with glibc (the default).

=== Writing GraalVM specific code

While it would be nice to have the same clojure code run within a GraalVM image as on the JVM, there may be times where a GraalVM specific workaround may be necessary.
GraalVM provides a class to detect when running in a GraalVM environment:

https://www.graalvm.org/sdk/javadoc/org/graalvm/nativeimage/ImageInfo.html

This class provides the following methods:

----
static boolean inImageBuildtimeCode()
Returns true if (at the time of the call) code is executing in the context of image building (e.g. in a static initializer of class that will be contained in the image).

static boolean inImageCode()
Returns true if (at the time of the call) code is executing in the context of image building or during image runtime, else false.

static boolean inImageRuntimeCode()
Returns true if (at the time of the call) code is executing at image runtime.

static boolean isExecutable()
Returns true if the image is build as an executable.

static boolean isSharedLibrary()
Returns true if the image is build as a shared library.
----

Currently, the ImageInfo class is https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/sdk/src/org.graalvm.nativeimage/src/org/graalvm/nativeimage/ImageInfo.java[implemented] by looking up specific keys using `java.lang.System/getProperty`.
Below are the known relevant property names and values:

Property name: `"org.graalvm.nativeimage.imagecode"` +
Values: `"buildtime"`, `"runtime"`

Property name: `"org.graalvm.nativeimage.kind"` +
Values: `"shared"`, `"executable"`

=== Java Native Interface
JNI contains a suite of tools for transfering datatypes between Java and C.
You can read about this API https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/specs/jni/functions.html[here for Java 17].

==== Watch for bugs
There have historically been bugs (https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/2152[example]) in the GraalVM implementations of some JNI functions.
If you encounter bugs with these API calls, you might try the latest development versions of GraalVM.
If bugs persist please https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues [raise them with with the Graal project].

==== Interfacing with native libraries
For interfacing with native libraries you can use JNI.

* https://github.com/borkdude/clojure-rust-graalvm[An example of a native Clojure program calling a Rust library].
* https://github.com/epiccastle/spire[Spire] is a real life project that combines GraalVM-compiled Clojure and C in a native binary.

To interface with C code using JNI:

. Write a java file is defining a class.
This class contains `public static native` methods defining the C functions you would like, their arguments and the return types.
https://github.com/epiccastle/spire/blob/master/src/c/SpireUtils.java[An example .java file from Spire].
. Generate a C `.h` header file from this java file:
 ** Java 11+ bundles this tool into `javac`.
Run javac on your `.java` _source file_ and specify a directory to store the header file: `javac -h destination_dir Library.java`
. Write a `.c` implementation file with function definitions that match the prototypes created in your generated `.h` file.
You will need to `#include` your generated `.h` header file.
https://github.com/epiccastle/spire/blob/master/src/c/SpireUtils.c[An example .c file from Spire].
. Compile the C code into a shared library as follows (we assume JAVA_HOME is setup as per GraalVM installation instructions):
** On linux:
+
[source,shell]
----
cc -I$JAVA_HOME/include -I$JAVA_HOME/include/linux -shared Library.c -o liblibrary.so -fPIC
----
** On MacOS:
+
[source,shell]
----
cc -I$JAVA_HOME/Contents/Home/include -I$JAVA_HOME/Contents/Home/include/darwin -dynamiclib -undefined suppress -flat_namespace Library.c -o liblibrary.dylib -fPIC
----
. Load the generated library at runtime from clojure via `(clojure.lang.RT/loadLibrary "library")`
. The JVM will need to be able to find the library on the standard library path.
This can be set via `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable or via the `ld` linker config file (`/etc/ld.so.conf` on linux).
Alternately you can set the library path by passing `-Djava.library.path="my_lib_dir"` to the java command line or by setting it at runtime with `(System/setProperty "java.library.path" "my_lib_dir")`
. Functions may be called via standard Java interop in clojure via the interface specified in your `Library.java` file (from step 1): `(Library/method args)`

=== macOS

==== Startup performance on macOS

@borkdude noticed https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/2136[slower startup times for babashka on macOS when using GraalVM legacy v20].
He elaborated in the @graalvm channel on Clojurians Slack:

____
The issue only happens with specific usages of certain classes that are somehow related to security, urls and whatnot.
So not all projects will hit this issue.
____

____
Maybe it's also related to enabling the SSL stuff.
Likely, but I haven't tested that hypothesis.
____

The Graal team closed the issue with the following absolutely reasonable rationales:

* {blank}
+
____
I don't think we can do much on this issue.
The problem is the inefficiency of the Apple dynamic linker/loader.
____

* {blank}
+
____
Yes, startup time is important, but correctness can of course never be compromised.
You are correct that a more precise static analysis could detect that, but our current context insensitive analysis it too limited.
____

Apple may fix this issue in macOS someday, who knows?
If you:

* have measured a slowdown in startup time of your `native-image` produced app after moving to Graal legacy v20
* want to restore startup app to what it was on macOS prior legacy v20 of Graal
* are comfortable with a "caveat emptor" hack from the Graal team

then you may want to try incorporating https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/2136#issuecomment-595688524[this Java code] with https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/2136#issuecomment-595814343[@borkdude's tweaks] into your project.

Here's how https://github.com/borkdude/babashka/commit/5723206ca2949a8e6443cdc38f8748159bcdce91[borkdude applied the fix to babashka].

==== Targeting a minimum macOS version

On macOS, GraalVM's `native-image` makes use of XCode command line tools.
XCode creates native binaries that specify the minimum macOS version required for execution.
This minimum version can change with each new release of XCode.

To explicitly tell XCode what minimum version is required for your native binary, you can set the `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` environment variable.

Here's an example @borkdude https://github.com/borkdude/babashka/blob/1efd3e6d3d57ef05e17972cfe4929b62cf270ce0/.circleci/config.yml#L214[setting `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` on CircleCI when building babashka].

Bonus tip: to check the the minimum macOS version required for a native binary, you can use `otool`.
Example for babashka native binary at the time of this writing:

[source,Shell]
----
> bb --version
babashka v1.3.182
> otool -l $(which bb) | grep -B1 -A3 MIN_MAC
Load command 9
      cmd LC_VERSION_MIN_MACOSX
  cmdsize 16
  version 10.13
      sdk 12.3
----

=== GraalVM development builds

Development builds of GraalVM can be found https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-dev-builds/releases[here].
Although, at the time of this writing, these builds seem to be tagged with the link:#graalvm-version-scheme-change][legacy version scheme], the artifacts follow the new version scheme.
These builds are intended for early testing feedback, but can disappear after a proper release has been made, so don't link to them from production CI builds.
